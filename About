In India, real volunteer opportunities for tech freshers — especially in data science and AI — are rare or often just for namesake.
Even when they exist, students don’t gain true, hands-on experience or client interaction. As a result, many freshers struggle to explain their projects in interviews because they’ve never worked on something meaningful or practical.

VirtuSolveAI was created to solve this problem. It offers genuine, real-time experience by allowing students to work directly with early-stage startups.

Yes — it's a volunteer tech opportunity for freshers in AI and data science, and yes — the experience gained through VirtuSolveAI is valid and can be used as professional experience, because you're solving real problems for real clients, just like a professional would.
